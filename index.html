					<h3>What is SwampHacks?</h3>
					<p>SwampHacks is a 24-hour hackathon (read: software development marathon) that is intended to bring makers of all experience levels together for a weekend to create some amazing things: grab some friends, cook up a crazy idea, and do everything in your power to make it a reality.</p>
					<p>Throughout the weekend, we'll have mountains of swag, corporate sponsors looking to recruit, and more free food than you could possible imagine. Aside from that - participation is completely FREE! No, we're not kidding.</p>
					
					<h3>Can I hack with a team?</h3>
					<p>Absolutely! Rome wasn't built in a day and it certainly wasn't built by one person: teams get things done! Meet other hackers, network, and make a #squad of your own. Teambuilding will be an informal process, so feel free to either walk in to the event with a team or join one once we get kicked off. Maximum 5 hackers per team.</p>
					
					<h3>How do I get there?</h3>
					<p>We'll be chartering buses as we get closer to the event so they can pick up students from nearby schools. Bus not coming to your school? No worries. We're working on a plan for group travel reimbursements. If you want to come to SwampHacks, we'll try our best to get you here.</p>

					<h3>What do I bring?</h3>
					<p>Every hacker has their own kit. We recommend hacking gear (laptop, charger, USB peripherals), a light jacket in case it gets cold, and some basic hygiene products (toothbrush/toothpaste, deodorant, etc) to keep you feeling fresh.</p>
					
					<h3>How much experience do I need?</h3>
					<p>NONE! ZERO! NADA! At the end of the day, it's the people that make a hackathon great. Whether you've been coding since you were 6 or you've never written a line of HTML in your life, everyone has something to gain from a hackathon. Think about this: even if you're new to programming, you have 24 hours to learn a new skill and demonstrate it with a product. Pretty cool, right?</p>
					
					<h3>Can I submit an older project?</h3>
					<p id="last">Out of fairness to the other competitors, we ask that no code dedicated to the project can have been written before the beginning of the event. Resurfacing a year-old project for a 24-hour competition just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
